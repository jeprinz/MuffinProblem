#This is a collection of a bunch of code that I've written for the muffin problem. I'll list the important files below:

 - bigrun.py: use this file to actually generate procedures (see comment in file)
 - integers.py: The actual procedure generating code is all in here. (See latex write up for algorithm, and also pretty well commented)
 - findq.py: Calculates the interval theorem bounds
 - general.py: Preliminary code for my algorithm
